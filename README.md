# Multilevel-Protein-Characterization-Model-ML_PC

In this work Multilevel Protein Characterization Model (ML_PC) has been proposed for the characteristics, species, and function characterization of protein sequences. Three different levels of predictions have been performed in ML_PC model. Folder “ML_PC” contains the codes and datasets for all levels (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3a, Level 3b, Level 3c) of the prediction.
